  <h1>Tour of HTML</h1>

  <p>
    P is for paragraph. Long pieces of text go in here.
    We can nest elements. Here is an "anchor" element (a tag):
    <a href="http://www.google.com">My Link</a>
    href on an "a" tag is our first attribute.
    It specifies the destination of a link.
  </p>

  <h3>Lists</h3>
  <p>
    We have 3 types of lists: ordered, unordered, and select lists. Select
    is a little different.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Here is the first item</li>
    <li>Here is the second</li>
  </ol>

  <ul>
    <li>This is a list item</li>
    <li>Here is another</li>
  </ul>

  <select>
    <option>Option 1</option>
    <option>Option 2</option>
    <option>Option C</option>
  </select>

  <h3>Tables</h3>
  <p>
    Tables in html consist of a number of nested tags.
    We'll need : table, thead, tbody, tr (row), th (for row heading), and td (data cell)
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Col 1</th>
        <th>Col 2</th>
        <th>Col 3</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Data 1</td>
        <td>Data 2</td>
        <td>Data 3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Data 4</td>
        <td>Data 5</td>
        <td>Data 6</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3>div and span elements</h3>

  <p>div is a division, a section of your page. It has no meaning and no default style.</p>
  <br>
  <p>span is similarly meaningless, but it is has "inline" style instead of "block" style.</p>

  <div>
    <p>
      This p tag is inside a div, not that we could tell. The div just organizes our page,
      seperating it out into sections.
      <span>This text is inside a span element, inside the p element</span>
    </p>
  </div>

  <h5>Inline vs. block</h5>

  <p>
    Block elements "own their own vertical space".
    They take up a horizontal band across the screen.
    Tables, h1-6s, p tags, div tags, are all block elements.
    <br>
    Inline elements don't own their own vertical space -- they
    make use of the space controlled by their parent element.
    A tags and span tags are inline elements.
    <br>
    The above is default behaviour -- we can change it with styling.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can also say that div is the generic block element and
    span is the generic inline element
  </p>

  <h5>Additional Inline Elements</h5>

  <p>Since inline elements just inherit space and fit in the same line, they
    can be used to mark text for decoration. <em>Emphasize with em</em>,
    <u>u for underlined, but don't use this (see MDN). Deprecated.</u>,
    <strong>Strong for something bold-like, doesn't have to be bold</strong>.
  </p>

  <h5>Typical Use of div and span</h5>

  <p>
    Since div and span are generic, we typically assign them class(es)
    attributes to specify their meaning and style. To some extent, div
    has been replaced with semantic tags in HTML5.
  </p>

  <h3>Semantic Tags (new in HTML5!)</h3>

  <p>
    Semantic tags were built with the intent of replacing many divs.
    Your semantic tags have no default style and represent structure, but
    each has a name with a meaning.
  </p>

  <header>This is in a header</header>
  <nav>This is in a nav</nav>
  <section>This is in a section</section>
  <footer>This is in a footer</footer>

  <p>
    These make your HTML more sensible. Better for developers and
    they partially replace ARIA(Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
    labels for accessibility.
  </p>

  <h3>Images</h3>

  <p>
    Images are used with the img tag.
    We specify a src, a title, and and alt for alternative text
  </p>

  <h5>Image linked from wikipedia:</h5>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/Yuri_Knorozov.jpg"
    alt="Picture of Yuri w/ cat on wikipedia">
  By <span title="must have been published or publicly displayed outside Wikipedia">Source</span> (<a
    href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Non-free_content_criteria#4"
    title="Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria">WP:NFCC#4</a>), <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yuri_Knorozov.jpg"
    title="Fair use of copyrighted material in the context of Yuri Knorozov">Fair use</a>, <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=60497701">Link</a>

  <h5>Image from local disk:</h5>
  <img src="Yuri_Knorozov.jpg" alt="Picture of Yuri w/ cat on local disk">

  <h3>New HTML5 media tags</h3>

  <p>
    HTML5 added native support for audio, video, and "canvas".  
    Canvas supports SVGs; it's the native replacement for flash.
  </p>

  <canvas></canvas>
  <video src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/examples/flower.webm" controls="controls"></video>
  <audio src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/examples/flower.webm" controls></audio>

  <h3>Forms</h3>

  <p>
    Forms are the HTML way of having users interact with your server.  They enable
    HTTP GET and HTTP POST requests without an JavaScript.
  </p>

  <form method="POST" action="mybrokensite.com">
    <label>
      Text Input
      <input type="text" name="texti">
    </label>
    
    <label>
      Number Input
      <input type="number" name="numberi">
    </label>

    <label for="filei">File Input</label>
    <input type="file" id="filei" name="filei">

    <label for="emaili">Email Input</label>
    <input type="email" id="emaili" name="emaili">
    <input type="submit">
  </form>

  <h3>Yahoo searcher</h3>
  <form method="GET" action="http://www.search.yahoo.com/search">
    <label for="q">Yahoo Search Query</label>
    <input type="text" name="q">
    <input type="submit">
  </form>

  <h3>Linked page</h3>

  <p>When linking to another page in the same folder, just use its name
    <a href="linkedpage.html">My Linked Page</a>
  </p>
</body>
